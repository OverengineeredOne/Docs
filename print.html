<p><em>by Sean O'Rourke, ...</em></p>
<p>Welcome to Overengineered's Developer Guide! This text assumes you have an understanding of 
programming and programming concepts.</p>
<p>A good portion of the tech stack is in Rust. Though this text does not require you to have a
strong Rust background, you should be familiar with the 
<a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/title-page.html">Rust Book</a>. If you haven't read it, everything's
shiny captian. Not to fret. If you have experience with Python or React, it's well written and not
difficult to get through.</p>
<p>In this text we'll take a journey through concepts that make up Overengineered and how we are 
tackling the big decentralization challenges that is inspiring the next version of the web. Once
we get a sense for the concepts we'll begin to develop a <strong>TODO</strong> app. Starting with the bare
features and slowly developing it into a modern decentralized app.</p>
<p>We will be <em>not</em> be going into great depth into each of the subjects covered in this book. We will
try to introduce you to concepts in a logical manor where you have an idea on where to look to 
unblock yourself or find additional resources.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="preface"><a class="header" href="#preface">Preface</a></h1>
<p>Before we get begin I wanted to give you a little background on Overengineered
and some of the original problems I set out to solve. Hopefully this will help
set the direction and tone of this book.</p>
<p>First, why Overengineered and what does the name mean? We'll it embodies the
spirit of <em>&quot;I'll spend four hours automating this task that only takes me five
minutes to complete.&quot;</em> I mean, I started this effort to help out a friend with
a problem with his small business... and now I'm writing a book. Now what
defines our platform and vision is a little more complicated. It mainly
derives from things inspired throughout my career.</p>
<p>I've worked within a large tech company for the last ten years solving
problems of various scale. My strength has always been solving problems that
drastically increase operational and development efficiency. Working in a
company like this we're often highly well tuned engines. Software engineering,
data science, data engineering, production engineering, user research,
language, content design, and many others all working to identify and tackle
these operational scale problems. We prioritize and eliminate cognitive and
physical manual work. This essentially allows entire organizations to operation
with minimal budget increases year over year as the number of end users within
their products scale to billions of users.</p>
<p>This have given me an interesting perspective on the product and services that
are available to us today and all the areas of opportunity where we are not
even scratching the surface. However applying this same discipline to my
personal projects, where I attempt to have direct impact in my day to day is a
challenge. The scope of solving some of these problems is substantial. It's
unfortunate that I have not come across a solution to having all the readily
building blocks to solve some of these problems without burning a significant
amount of calories planning, budgeting materials, setting up my infrastructure,
writing the glue code between services or devices.</p>
<p>Don't get me wrong, existing solutions exist but all now require a cloud
service, which has it's advantages, but the current trend is moving toward
decentralization.</p>
<p>This decentralization effort is the other driving factors that influence's the
direction of Overengineered. To me, the reason behind this seems to be trust.
People want their data secure, protected, private, and available. The industry
seems to be leaning toward blockchain as an attempt to solve these problems. It
is a great tool and has a purpose, but in my opinion is to expensive and slow
to be used everywhere.</p>
<p>So, I asked myself, why not bring the cloud infrastructure home? Make it as
easy as Installing an operating system. Adding a new computer or device is as
easy as scanning a QR code. This is prefect for processing sensitive and
private data such as facial recognition on security cameras. As well as
tracking individuals throughout the house to apply individualized home
automation and contextual interaction with IoT devices.</p>
<p>If we are hosting our own trusted infrastructure, we still want to be able to
create interconnected and social experiences. This is where we can build a data
service and abstraction layer, including public registry support to download
and managing data schemas.</p>
<p>Progressive web apps can connect to any one or more hosted data service and in
the event the server does not have the required dependencies, they can be
fetched from one of the available registries. This public and transparent data
model approach has the added benefit of creating a large data graph. Other
abstractions can be made on top to provide a federated learning platform.</p>
<p>Not only could this enrich the value of user data to something beyond whats
easily attainable today. But gives the true owner of the data power and the
ability to monetize their own anonymized data in a safe and secure manor.</p>
<p>This defines our north stars or what I hope to achieve. This is a long term
vision and much of this will inevitably change. Thank you for reading, and
enjoy. :)</p>
<p>-- Sean O'Rourke</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="introduction"><a class="header" href="#introduction">Introduction</a></h1>
<p>Overengineered is here to help you develop fast, efficient, and safe
decentralized apps. We accomplish this by providing an easy to install <em>cloud
at home</em>, where decentralized services can be installed like an app on your
phone.</p>
<p>A GraphQL <em>data abstraction service</em> and decentralized <em>registries</em> are
provided to help distribute data schemas. Progressive Web Apps provide
requirements to the abstraction service that can then be fetched and installed
from the registry.</p>
<p>This should enable developers to move quickly to implement new products and
features. We also want to provide all the glue needed to develop within this
environment in a cohesive manor.</p>
<h2 id="rust"><a class="header" href="#rust">Rust</a></h2>
<p>In the spirit of trying to create a safe and secure platform that treats data
ownership as a first class feature; Rust feels like a natural fit.</p>
<p>Note that the current state of many of the dependencies are not considered
stable. Therefore our platform will not be considered stable or support
backwards compatibility between versions. These guarantees will likely evolve
over time, but for now expect rapid breaking changes.</p>
<h2 id="who-is-this-book-for"><a class="header" href="#who-is-this-book-for">Who is this book for?</a></h2>
<p>This book has no expectations on the audience's background. It is ideal for any
developer who wants to quickly deliver decentralized apps or who are just
interested to see how this landscape is changing with the next generation of
the internet.</p>
<h2 id="how-to-use-this-book"><a class="header" href="#how-to-use-this-book">How to use this book</a></h2>
<p>We try to structure the book so you get introduced to a new topic with a little
background and further reading before moving into a project that will be
continuously developed throughout this book.</p>
<p>The app that we will be developing and breaking down is a simple TODO app. We
will be slowly introducing you to more and more features as we shape it to
something that is actually useful.</p>
<p>We will be covering a broad range of topics, which will all require their own
set of dependencies. To make sure, as a reader, you can follow along, we have
developed tools to manage the dependencies in a secure environment. These will
be covered in later chapters.</p>
<h2 id="source-code"><a class="header" href="#source-code">Source Code</a></h2>
<p>The source files from this book can be found in the github repo
<a href="https://github.com/overengineered/docs">GitHub</a> and will be found under the
folder following the folder naming pattern of
<code>booktitle-chapter-section-title</code>.</p>
<h2 id="stack"><a class="header" href="#stack">Stack</a></h2>
<p>Briefly let's cover the stack that we will be working with. Later we'll have a
gentle introduction to many of them and others may not require direct
interaction with, but it may be important to know for debugging purposes.</p>
<p>You can follow up on any of these topics to learn more.</p>
<h3 id="frontend"><a class="header" href="#frontend">Frontend</a></h3>
<p>The frontend is what the user sees when they load a web page or views one of
apps using Overengineered. Web being the dominate platform today, we choose a
lot of our decisions around that. WebAssembly is how we are able to create apps
that support a wide range of architecture and devices.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Yew</strong> - Yew is a Rust Crate similar to <a href="https://reactjs.org/">React</a>. They
both use a virtual dom, components return a JSX like syntax and have both a
class and functional implementation with hooks into state and lifecycle
management.</li>
<li><strong>GraphQL</strong> - <a href="https://graphql.org/">GraphQL</a> was chosen as the primary
server / client communication to minimize network traffic. With the ever
growing number of devices we want to keep payloads as small as possible.
GraphQL provides a very nice abstraction for developers and has existing
client libraries for many languages including Rust.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="backend"><a class="header" href="#backend">Backend</a></h3>
<p>All of the services that need to run to keep the lights running and the apps
working.</p>
<h4 id="webserver"><a class="header" href="#webserver">Webserver</a></h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Rocket</strong> - <a href="https://rocket.rs/">Rocket</a> is the primary recommended way to
create a user facing web server. Rocket is a Rust Crate that focuses on a great
developer experience with an easy to use API. We think this fits perfectly
with what we are trying to accomplish. And many Overengineered Rust Crates
take inspiration from this.</li>
<li><strong>GraphQL</strong> - Like previously mentioned for various reasons we use GraphQL.
GraphQL is very easy to integrate with Rocket.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="devops"><a class="header" href="#devops">DevOps</a></h3>
<p>These cover the infrastructure that the cloud at home services use to manage
and deploy the apps used for the cloud apps as well as the development
environments. Don't worry most of this will soon be abstracted away and will
not require expertise in to use Overengineered. We will cover enough
information to be able to unblock yourself in the case of an issue or
unforeseen problem.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Docker</strong> - We primarily use <a href="https://docker.com/">Docker</a> for the build
tools, but use <a href="https://containerd.io/">Containard</a> for the container
service.</li>
<li><strong>Kubernetes</strong> - <a href="https://kubernetes.io/">Kubernetes</a> is a container
orchestration service to manage containers across all devices within your
network. We specifically use <a href="https://k3s.io/">k3s</a> since it supports the arm
architecture and can easily be ran on Raspberry Pi to enable low cost
hardware and low power consumption.</li>
<li><strong>Template Cluster K3s</strong> - An
<a href="https://github.com/k8s-at-home/template-cluster-k3s">opinionated</a>

<p>Let's get started! We'll start by installing all the prerequisites then dive
into the fundamental pieces of Overengineered.</p>
<p>We want to ensure rapid development and minimize setup times for your
development environment and tools. We accomplish this by utilizing Docker and
in the future will provide a web based environment. We will go into more detail
in the following chapters, but for now know, Our image has Ubuntu as the base
image. Also comes with all the tools preinstalled to follow along with the
Overengineered books.</p>
<h2 id="installing-docker"><a class="header" href="#installing-docker">Installing Docker</a></h2>
<h3 id="ubuntu-and-debian-based-operating-systems-including-raspberry-pi"><a class="header" href="#ubuntu-and-debian-based-operating-systems-including-raspberry-pi">Ubuntu and Debian based Operating Systems including Raspberry Pi</a></h3>
<p>You can find install instructions for ubuntu at
<a href="https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/ubuntu/">docs.docker.com</a>. To make
this process even easier We've created a convenience script to get you set up
with Docker quickly. Go ahead and copy paste this into your terminal.</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust ignore">wget -O - https://raw.githubusercontent.com/OverengineeredOne/easy-docker-setup/main/debian.sh | bash
</code></pre>
<p>If you find any issues with the script, please, fill out an issue on
<a href="https://github.com/OverengineeredOne/easy-docker-setup">github</a></p>
<h4 id="set-up-overengineered"><a class="header" href="#set-up-overengineered">Set up Overengineered</a></h4>
<p>Everything's shiny captain, a development environment doesn't exist yet. If you
read ahead you can build from the source.</p>
<h3 id="mac-os-x"><a class="header" href="#mac-os-x">Mac Os X</a></h3>
<h3 id="windows"><a class="header" href="#windows">Windows</a></h3>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: Will likely provide instructions for a VM using hypervisor.</p>
<h2 id="building-from-source"><a class="header" href="#building-from-source">Building from source</a></h2>
<p>Since the entire development environment is a container image, we can download
the source from github and build it our selves.</p>
<p>For this we'll need to make sure we have git installed.</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust ignore">apt install git-all
</code></pre>
<p>Next clone the repository and navigate into the new directory.</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust ignore">git clone https://github.com/OverengineeredOne/oedev.git &amp;&amp; cd oedev
</code></pre>
<p>Finally just build the image! This part may take some time.</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust ignore">docker build -t oedev .
</code></pre>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="development-environment"><a class="header" href="#development-environment">Development Environment</a></h1>
<p>Overengineered has a very opinionated full stack environment. To make the
installation of all the dependencies and tools hassle free, we created a Docker
image that has all of these prepackaged for convenience.</p>
<p>If you are not familiar with Docker, it is a quick and secure way to package
applications consistently and just work. Docker is similar to a virtual
operating system were it only shares the kernel with the underlying system. It
provides a declarative interface to compose images and can be published onto
repositories. This makes it easy to share, not just code, but all the
requirements including the environment.</p>
<p>Once the images are created, they can be cold started extremely quickly which
is what we want.</p>
<h2 id="launching-the-environment"><a class="header" href="#launching-the-environment">Launching the environment</a></h2>
<p>Once Docker is installed and the image is built. You can start the image and
jump into a bash session with the container with this command.</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust ignore">docker run -it oedev /bin/bash
</code></pre>
<p>In this case the <code>i</code> flag is indicating that we want to open an interactive SSH
session to the container. The <code>t</code> flag allows to run commands interactively.</p>
<p>After the command is run the Docker container should boot up quickly. As soon
as it is booted a ssh session should kick in and connect you to the container.</p>
<h2 id="setting-up"><a class="header" href="#setting-up">Setting up</a></h2>
<p>Once your successfully connected, we'll need to set up a few things before we
get too deep in. Overengineered uses Github for our code repository and we will
be setting up several repositories throughout this book.</p>
<h3 id="github-cli-gh"><a class="header" href="#github-cli-gh">Github CLI (gh)</a></h3>
<p>The Github CLI is already shipped with the Docker image. Let's start by logging
in. This process is simple, we just need to run one command. But first let's
grab a personal access token. Instructions can be found at the
<a href="https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/creating-a-personal-access-token">github docs</a>.</p>
<p>To make this easier we've include the instructions here, but they can be found
in the developer settings.</p>
<ul>
<li>In the upper-right corner of any page, click on your <code>profile photo</code> and
<code>settings</code>.</li>
<li>In the left navigation bar click on <code>Developer settings</code>.</li>
<li>Then in the left panel click <code>Personal access tokens</code>.</li>
<li>Click <code>Generate new token</code>.</li>
<li>Fill out the details and click <code>generate</code>.</li>
<li>Make sure you copy the token.</li>
</ul>
<p>Now create a new file in the root of your home directory called <code>ghtoken.txt</code>
with the contents of the copied token.</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash ignore">echo &lt;your_token&gt; &gt; ~/ghtoken.txt
</code></pre>
<p>Now edit this file and paste the contents of your GitHub token in it.</p>
<p>Now from the SSH session we established with the Docker container run the
command to login. Replace &lt;your_token&gt; with the token file we created in the
previous step.</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash ignore">gh auth login --with-token &lt; ~/ghtoken.txt
</code></pre>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> This step will have to be done each time you launch the dev
environment.</p>
<h2 id="stopping-the-container"><a class="header" href="#stopping-the-container">Stopping the container</a></h2>
<p>There is no persistent data in this development environment. As soon as the
container is no longer running all modified files will be gone forever. There
are a couple ways to deal with this, you can use source control or a remote
home directory. (<em>Currently not supported</em>)</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="command-line-interface"><a class="header" href="#command-line-interface">Command Line Interface</a></h1>
<p>The development environment ships with a command line tool to help take care of
a lot of the boilerplate and configuration within Overengineered.</p>
<p>This tool is not meant to replace existing command line tools, but address
common tasks such as, setting up a new cloud, set up a new progressive web app,
setting up boilerplate templates, installing, and uploading apps to
repositories.</p>
<p>If you are using the Overengineered Development Environment the CLI comes
preinstalled and can be accessed with <code>oecli</code>.</p>
<p>For more details on the specific command line options that are available you
can use the help section.</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust ignore">oecli --help
</code></pre>
<p>We will dive into more details into the individual commands in the upcoming
chapters as they are introduced.</p>
<h2 id="manual-installation"><a class="header" href="#manual-installation">Manual Installation</a></h2>
<p>If you are not within the Overengineered dev environment you can install
<code>oecli</code> through Cargo.</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust ignore">cargo install oecli
</code></pre>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="webassembly"><a class="header" href="#webassembly">WebAssembly</a></h1>
<p>At the time of writing WebAssembly is sill new and is already gaining steam as
the next big player in web development. It has a massive amount of potential
to evolve and change the way applications are built and shipped.</p>
<h2 id="what-is-webassembly"><a class="header" href="#what-is-webassembly">What is WebAssembly?</a></h2>
<p>I'll never do as good as a job as
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HktWin_LPf4">Lin Clark's A Cartoon Intro to WebAssembly</a>,
but I'll try.</p>
<p>WebAssembly solves the problem to allow applications to be built for the
browser, written in languages other than Javascript. Javascript is much slower
and there are a lot of problems that can not be solved with it today.
WebAssembly is a low level assembly like language that is converted into a
binary format this allows applications to run, without installation and provide
native performance. It also works on Windows, Mac, Linux, iOS, Android, and
many others.</p>
<h2 id="the-future-of-webassembly"><a class="header" href="#the-future-of-webassembly">The future of WebAssembly</a></h2>
<p>WebAssembly is still new, for example today there is a lot of JS interop. As
data is passed around it's serialized / deserialized and causes some major
performance issues that in some cases doesn't make it practical to use. In the
future it will have more functionality such as direct DOM and Websocket
access.</p>
<h2 id="wasi"><a class="header" href="#wasi">WASI</a></h2>
<p>WASI or the WebAssembly System Interface is exciting since it brings
WebAssembly to the backend. This is exciting for a few reasons, every WASI
module runs in it's secure environment, interfaces allow for easy interop
between languages, and finally cold start times are nearly instantaneous.
Drastically quicker than Docker.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="yew"><a class="header" href="#yew">Yew</a></h1>
<p>Yew is a modern Rust framework for creating multi-threaded front-end web
applications with WebAssembly.</p>
<p>Like React, Yew is a component based framework which makes it easy to create
interactive UIs. Inside, Yew's performance is achieved by minimizing DOM calls
and offloading processing into background threads.</p>
<h2 id="introduction-1"><a class="header" href="#introduction-1">Introduction</a></h2>
<p>Let's take a look at how to build an example Yew app. If you are using the
Overengineered development environment we are good to go and can skip the next
step. If not, there are a couple of prerequisites you'll need to set up.</p>
<h3 id="prerequisites"><a class="header" href="#prerequisites">Prerequisites</a></h3>
<p><strong>This step is only required if you are not using the development
environment.</strong> You'll need to make sure you have the following tools and they
are up to date.</p>
<ul>
<li>Rust</li>
<li>trunk</li>
<li>Compile target wasm32-unknown-unknown</li>
</ul>
<p><em>You can reference earlier chapters for instructions on installing rust.</em></p>
<p>After Rust is installed, you can use Cargo to install <code>trunk</code>.</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust ignore">cargo install trunk
</code></pre>
<p>The compile target is covered later.</p>
<h3 id="setting-up-the-yew-project"><a class="header" href="#setting-up-the-yew-project">Setting up the Yew Project</a></h3>
<p>For this project, we will need to expose the port 8080 so we can load the page
in the browser later.</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust ignore">docker run -it -p 8080:8080 oedev /bin/bash
</code></pre>
<p>Here we are adding <code>-p 8080:8080</code> to the earlier command to launch the
development environment. We are telling Docker that we want port 8080 to be
opened inside container and we also want to map that to port 8080 on the host
computer.</p>
<p>Once your environment is relaunched with port 8080 mapped let's go ahead and
create our project.</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust ignore">cargo new example-yew-project
cd example-yew-project
</code></pre>
<p>And to verify everything works perform an initial run with Cargo (<code>cargo run</code>)
and you should see the expected Hello, World! example.</p>
<h2 id="building-a-web-page"><a class="header" href="#building-a-web-page">Building a web page</a></h2>
<p>The first thing we want to make sure we do is add the WASM (WebAssembly) build
target by running:</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust ignore">rustup target add wasm32-unknown-unknown
</code></pre>
<p>Now we can making some updates to our Cargo.toml file to add the new Yew
dependency.</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust ignore">[package]
name = &quot;example-yew-project&quot;
version = &quot;0.1.0&quot;
edition = &quot;2021&quot;

[dependencies]
yew = &quot;0.19&quot;

</code></pre>
<p>Open up <code>src/main.rs</code> and create a simple component that renders the message
<code>Hello, World!</code>. I'll go ahead and show you what it looks like then, we'll
break it down.</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust ignore">use yew::prelude::*;

#[function_component(App)]
fn app() -&gt; Html {
    html! {
			&lt;h1&gt;{ &quot;Hello, World!&quot; }&lt;/h1&gt;
    }
}

fn main() {
    yew::start_app::&lt;App&gt;();
}
</code></pre>
<p>The <code>function_component()</code> macro creates a component, in this case with the
name <code>App</code>. Function components are a simplified components. They return a JSX
like syntax and this is exactly what is rendered.</p>
<p>A couple things to note about the html macro.</p>
<ul>
<li>Expressions can be used but must be wrapped in curly braces <code>{ }</code></li>
<li>There must only be one root node. You can wrap them in a fragment <code>&lt;&gt;&lt;/&gt;</code></li>
</ul>
<p>Before we can see what this looks like in the browser let's make sure we add
<code>index.html</code> to the root of the project. This is still a webpage and just like
in React, we still have to define a index.html to serve to the client.</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust ignore">&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;
&lt;html lang=&quot;en&quot;&gt;
    &lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;body&gt;

    &lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>If you notice we don't add anything to the children of the body element. This
is because Yew will insert this data for us. Looking at the provided example
above, when <code>yew::start::&lt;App&gt;();</code> is ran it will replace the children of body
with the return value of <code>app()</code>.</p>
<h3 id="viewing-the-page"><a class="header" href="#viewing-the-page">Viewing the page</a></h3>
<p>During development we need to be able to view the changes as we develop. This
is where trunk comes in to help us. Run the following command to build and
serve the application.</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust ignore">trunk serve
</code></pre>
<p>From here you can navigate to your browser and try reaching the webpage with
the default IP Address. <code>http://172.17.0.1:8080</code></p>
<p>Congratulations, you've built your first Yew app!</p>
<h3 id="watching-changes"><a class="header" href="#watching-changes">Watching changes</a></h3>
<p>A big part of this development flow is being able to instantly see your changes
as your are developing. Today this is sadly not possible. The next steps before
we can get there are to install an ssh server on the docker image. Development
instructions will be updated to reflect changes to use a traditional ssh client
to connect to the dev environment. Instructions for tools like VSCode will be
added.</p>
<h3 id="hooks"><a class="header" href="#hooks">Hooks</a></h3>
<p>Hooks are Yew functions that allow you to tie into the lifecycle or state of a
component. We will take a look at
<a href="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">use_state</a>.</p>
<p><code>use_state</code> allows us to create and set a default value to be used within the
component. The <code>UseStateHandle</code> it returns has a method that allows us to
change the state value. This will in turn update the component.</p>
<p>Let's update our app method to test it out.</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust ignore">use yew::{Callback, function_component, html, use_state};

#[function_component(App)]
fn app() -&gt; Html {
    let counter = use_state(|| 0);
    let onclick = {
        let counter = counter.clone();
        Callback::from(move |_| counter.set(*counter + 1))
    };
    html! {
			&lt;div&gt;
				&lt;button {onclick}&gt;{ &quot;Add one&quot; }&lt;/button&gt;
				&lt;p&gt;{ &quot;Total: &quot; }{ *counter }&lt;/p&gt;
			&lt;/div&gt;
    }
}

</code></pre>
<p>You can see here we call <code>use_state()</code> and assign it to the variable <code>counter</code>.
We're also passing in a callback. This allows us to set a default the value. In
this case <code>0</code>.</p>
<p>We use <code>counter</code> two ways. One directly in the return value. We <code>dereference</code>
<code>counter</code> and display that as the &quot;total&quot; value.</p>
<p>The other is in the <code>onClick</code> <code>handle</code>. Inside this callback we clone the
reference and move it's ownship into the <code>Callback</code> struct. You can see
<code>onClick</code> being passed into the <code>&lt;button /&gt;</code>'s <code>props</code>. Yew will map the
onclick <code>HTMLEvent</code> to this <code>onClick</code> function you defined. When the &quot;Add One
Button&quot; is clicked you will see the <code>counter</code>'s value get set to <code>counter + 1</code>.</p>
<p>Go ahead and <code>trunk serve</code>. You can see as you click the button and test it out.</p>
<h3 id="further-reading"><a class="header" href="#further-reading">Further Reading</a></h3>
<p>We are only covering a very small introduction to Yew, just to get your feet
wet. I'll highly recommend following up with the Yew documentation.</p>

<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="component-library"><a class="header" href="#component-library">Component Library</a></h1>
<p>Now that we know how to create components we would like to build something
that's more ascetically pleasing. But creating high quality complex user
interfaces from scratch is a big challenge. This is where a Component Library
can help. They establish the design language and as a developer we get to spend
less time thinking about this.</p>
<p>At this time there is not a feature complete component library for Yew. And out
of the handful of existing projects,
<a href="https://github.com/ctron/patternfly-yew">patternfly-yew</a> is the only one
recently maintained.</p>
<h2 id="patternfly"><a class="header" href="#patternfly">Patternfly</a></h2>
<p>Patternfly is an open source design system to create consistent and usable
applications experiences. Patternfly provides clear standards and guidelines to
build efficiently. It was designed as a React component library, however there
is a community effort recreate the components on an as needed basis for Yew.</p>
<p>Given the current state of the Rust project, it would be best to start to get
to know the library though the React documentation.</p>
<p>Getting started with Patternfly is pretty straightforward, you'll get immediate
value from two primary sections. Components and Layouts.</p>
<h2 id="components"><a class="header" href="#components">Components</a></h2>
<p>If we pull up the documentation for the
<a href="https://www.patternfly.org/v4/components/alert">Alert</a> component we're greeted
to all of the examples. The different examples show the implementation of the
component and different ways to use it.</p>
<p>You can take a look at the code under each example with the <code>&lt;/&gt; JS</code> button.
The very bottom of the page contains the props, which tells you about all of
the properties to control the behavior of the component.</p>
<h3 id="guidelines"><a class="header" href="#guidelines">Guidelines</a></h3>
<p>The
<a href="https://www.patternfly.org/v4/components/alert/design-guidelines">Design Guidelines</a>
exists for most component and provides details what the expected behaviors and
how the user interacts with it. Many will also contain best practices and how
they should be used with the other Patternfly components.</p>
<h3 id="patternfly-rs"><a class="header" href="#patternfly-rs">patternfly-rs</a></h3>
<p>Let's look at the equivalent
<a href="https://ctron.github.io/patternfly-yew-quickstart/">Rust Doc</a> and find the
<code>Alert</code> component. patternfly-rs uses the same CSS as the React library so the
components should look identical. Like the upstream Patternfly documentation,
it should contain the code snippet, but currently nothing else. Unlike the
React documentation, the code is just simply positioned below.</p>
<p>At the current stage there is not a lot of components and the example page does
not meet parity with React, but should be a good place to start.</p>
<p>To see all of the components that have been completed, a better resource is
available on the
<a href="https://docs.rs/patternfly-yew/latest/patternfly_yew/index.html">Rust Docs</a>.</p>
<h2 id="using-patternfly-rs"><a class="header" href="#using-patternfly-rs">Using patternfly-rs</a></h2>
<p>patternfly-rs also includes a
<a href="https://github.com/ctron/patternfly-yew">quickstart template</a> that ships with
the entire patternfly-rs documentation page. Normally from the github page you
click the use <code>Use this template</code> button, clone the repo and install everything
with npm.</p>
<p>But the Overengineered CLI can take care of this for us. We can do all of this
with a single command. You don't have to do this now but you can use the
following command, replacing <code>&lt;name&gt;</code> with the name of the project name. This
will clone the repository using the name as the name of the repo.</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust ignore">oecli pwa --new &lt;name&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>Just like our previous examples, run <code>trunk serve</code> and head to your browser to
check it out.</p>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: <code>pwa</code> here stands for Progressive Web App. Progressive web apps are
apps that load a skeleton and hydrate components as they are ready. At this
current state, Overengineered does not offer server side rendering, or this
progressive hydration. These are goals further down the road map.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="todo-app"><a class="header" href="#todo-app">Todo App</a></h1>
<p>Now let's apply what we have covered so far and build something useful. We want
something that can be viewed on desktop mobile, and be feature rich.</p>
<p>Let's create a TODO app. As a user I should be able to create a todo and assign
it to myself or another person. TODOs are automatically generated for daily
tasks, and some are triggered from an external integration, such as Alexa.
And we will create some automation to automatically cross off our TODOs. We'll
add additional features like notifications, change history, and some analytical
pages or dashboards.</p>
<h2 id="create-the-project"><a class="header" href="#create-the-project">Create the project</a></h2>
<p>We want to clone the patternfly-rs template. If you recall we can easily do
this with the <code>pwa</code> subcommand of <code>oecli</code>. Again make sure you are logged into
github <code>gh auth login --with-token &lt;token_file&gt;</code>.</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust ignore">oecli pwa --new todo-client
</code></pre>
<p>Now you can navigate into the new directory and try serving the page with
trunk. <code>trunk serve</code> and accessing with your browser as before.</p>
<h3 id="template"><a class="header" href="#template">Template</a></h3>
<p>The default template comes with all the code for the example page. We don't
really care about it. Inside the <code>./src</code> folder, we can delete everything but
<code>main.rs</code> and <code>app.rs</code>. If we do this, we can also get rid of all of the
structs for Yew Routing. The only one we should care about is the struts <code>Model</code></p>
<pre><code class="language-rust ignore">use patternfly_yew::*;
use yew::prelude::*;

pub struct Model {}

impl yew::Component for Model {
  type Message = ();
  type Properties = ();
  fn create(_: &amp;Context&lt;Self&gt;) -&gt; Self {
    Self {}
  }

  fn view(&amp;self, _: &amp;Context&lt;Self&gt;) -&gt; Html {
    &lt;&gt;

    &lt;/&gt;
  }
}

</code></pre>
<p>You may also notice this is not a function_component, you can go ahead and
convert that on your own.</p>
<h2 id="design"><a class="header" href="#design">Design</a></h2>
<p>Now that we have a blank page we will start simple. We want to have some text
box for entering in a todo and a button to submit. We'll also need to see a
list of todos and some way to cross them off. We'll stick with these features
for this chapter.</p>
<p>Let's break down some of the components we'll be using.</p>
<h3 id="add-a-todo"><a class="header" href="#add-a-todo">Add a todo</a></h3>
<p>For the new TODO entry, a simple design would be to just place a text box and a
button next to each other.</p>
<pre><code class="language-txt ignore">+---------------------+ +--------+
|    Text Box         | | Submit |
+---------------------+ +--------+
</code></pre>
<p>We care about the text in the box and when the button is submitted we want to
&quot;submit&quot; the data that was entered into the text box.</p>
<p>What Patternfly Components would we need and how would we lay them out? Well we
can find the Button in the patternfly-rs documentation but nothing that really
fits the text box. The upstream Patternfly React documentation does have the
<a href="https://www.patternfly.org/v4/components/text-input">Text Input</a>. But ah, it
does exist in the
<a href="https://docs.rs/patternfly-yew/latest/patternfly_yew/struct.TextInput.html">patternfly-rs docs</a></p>
<p>Ok, now how would we place them next to each other? I'll let you take look at
the layouts to find out what works best:

<p>Given this, let's see what our component should start to look like.</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust ignore">#[function_component(NewTodoBar)]
fn new_todo() -&gt; Html {
  html! {
    &lt;Split gutter=true&gt;
      &lt;SplitItem&gt;
        &lt;TextInput placeholder={ &quot;New TODO&quot; } /&gt;
      &lt;/SplitItem&gt;
      &lt;SplitItem&gt;
        &lt;Button
          disabled={false}
          label={ &quot;Create&quot; }
          variant={Variant::Primary}
        /&gt;
      &lt;/SplitItem&gt;
    &lt;/Split&gt;
  }
}
</code></pre>
<p>You can add this directly in the Model component and use <code>trunk serve</code> it to
test it out.</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust ignore">impl yew::Component for Model {
...
fn view(&amp;self, _:&amp;Context&lt;Self&gt;) -&gt; Html {
  html! {
    &lt;&gt;
      &lt;NewTodoBar /&gt;
    &lt;/&gt;
  }
}
</code></pre>
<p>Looks much better than the counter example earlier, but we can still do better.
Let's find some layouts that might work for us. Our goal is to create something
like this.</p>
<pre><code class="language-txt ignore">+----------------------------------------+
| +------------------------------------+ |
| | +---------------------+ +--------+ | |
| | |    Text Box         | | Submit | | |
| | +---------------------+ +--------+ | |
| +------------------------------------+ |
|                                        |
| +------------------------------------+ |
| |                                    | |
| |                                    | |
| |                                    | |
| |                                    | |
| +------------------------------------+ |
+----------------------------------------+
</code></pre>
<p>Where the <code>NewTodoBar</code> component is centered within the parent component and
the <code>TextInput</code> fills the space up to the button. The parent component should
fill the width that's available and down to a minium of some value that looks
good on a mobile display.</p>
<p>There should be one additional parent that sets a max width. This component
should also pad the content. Other than the <code>NewTodoBar</code> there should be a
section to display the current TODOs. We'll use a <code>Card</code> as a placeholder for
now. All of this should be placed inside a layout.</p>
<h2 id="layouts"><a class="header" href="#layouts">Layouts</a></h2>
<p>In Patternfly there are seven different layouts to help compose your web app.
We can briefly cover each of them and what they are good for.</p>
<h3 id="stack-1"><a class="header" href="#stack-1">Stack</a></h3>
<p>A <a href="patternfly.org/v4/layouts/stack">stack</a> will position items vertically in a
container. Optionally one item can be used to fill the remaining space. All
children will be padded and centered adding a nice border. By default the
components are crammed together but can add spacing between with the optional
gutter.</p>
<h3 id="split"><a class="header" href="#split">Split</a></h3>
<p><a href="patternfly.org/v4/layouts/split">Split</a> is pretty much exactly the same as
stack, but horizontally. This one also has the option of wrapping the children
into an extra row if it doesn't fit the width of the screen. When viewing the
example adjust the width of the browser and you can see how the components
wrap.</p>
<h3 id="grid"><a class="header" href="#grid">Grid</a></h3>
<p><a href="patternfly.org/v4/layouts/grid">Grid</a> is allows you to layout content on a
fixed-size 12 column grid. This makes the behavior predictable and divisible by
1/2, 1/3, 1/4, 1/6 evenly. You can construct children of any size.</p>
<p>Grid does have a responsive ordering features, which allows you change which
order they appear based on the current window size.</p>
<h3 id="gallery"><a class="header" href="#gallery">Gallery</a></h3>
<p>Like Grid, the <a href="patternfly.org/v4/layouts/gallery">Gallery</a> will use a grid
like layout this time evenly placing the children. The view is response, so
depending on the screen size you can adjust the sizing of the children.</p>
<h3 id="level"><a class="header" href="#level">Level</a></h3>
<p><a href="patternfly.org/v4/layouts/level">Level</a> evenly distributes the children
horizontally within a container.</p>
<h3 id="bullseye"><a class="header" href="#bullseye">Bullseye</a></h3>
<p>The <a href="patternfly.org/v4/layouts/bullseye">Bullseye</a> will center the content both
horizontally and vertically.</p>
<h3 id="flex"><a class="header" href="#flex">Flex</a></h3>
<p>The Flex layout allows you to build your own custom layouts that give you the
same look and feel as the other PatternFly components and layouts. This enables
developers to create a custom layout that can have consistent spacing and
change responsively with other PatternFly layouts and components.</p>
