# Overengineered Docs

At Overengineered we build developer and user productivity tools. We want to enable people
with a platform where they can move quickly without having to get bogged down by anything outside 
of problem solving and implementation.

We currently have the first developer guide 
[mdBooks](https://rust-lang.github.io/mdBook/index.html) in progress. You can start reading here
on Github. [https://overengineeredone.github.io/docs/](https://overengineeredone.github.io/docs/)

### Contributions

Contributions are always welcome! However at this stage, before throwing up a pull request open up
an issue to start a discussion. Since this project is still in very early stages direction is 
subject to change rapidly.
