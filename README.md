# Overengineered Docs

At Overengineered we build developer and user productivity tools. Our
platform allows developers to move design, program, and distribute a wide range
of applications. Our tools are all fully open source and serve as examples
using our infrastructure.

## Overengineered Spec

We are beginning to layout a series of feature requirements to solve a sizeable
amount of problems. We then break down each requirement into a working spec.
The spec is a [mdBook](https://rust-lang.github.io/mdBook/index.html).

## Developer Guide

We have an early draft of a developer guide in the form of a
mdBook. It currently acts as a tutorial on using or platform.

Progress on the developer guide is on hold until we have a more clear picture
of the direction.

You can start reading here on Github.
