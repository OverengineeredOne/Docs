# Overengineered Docs

At Overengineered we build developer and user productivity tools. We want to enable engineers, 
programmers, developers, data scientists, anyone really, with a platform where they can move 
quickly without having to get bogged down by anything outside of problem solving and 
implementation.

The docs are broken down into two [mdBooks](https://rust-lang.github.io/mdBook/index.html). 
One an end user guide (*Does not exist*) and a developer guide.

### Contributions

Contributions are always welcome! However at this stage, before throwing up a pull request open up
an issue to start a discussion. Since this project is still in very early stages direction is 
subject to change rapidly.
