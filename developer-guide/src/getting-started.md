# Getting Started

Let's get started! We'll start by installing all the prerequisites then dive into the fundamental 
pieces of Overengineered.

To ensure rapid development we want to minimize the setup times for your development environment 
and tools to follow along with the book as much as possible.

We accomplish this by utilizing docker and in the future will provide a web based environment. 
We use Ubuntu as the base image and comes with all the tools required to be installed to follow 
along with the book.

## Debian / Ubuntu


### Set up Docker

We've created a convenience script to get you set up with docker more quickly. Go ahead and copy 
paste this into your terminal.

```rust,ignore
wget -O - https://raw.githubusercontent.com/OverengineeredOne/easy-docker-setup/main/debian.sh | bash
```

If you find any issues with the script, please, fill out an issue on 
[github](https://github.com/OverengineeredOne/easy-docker-setup)
