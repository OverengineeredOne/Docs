# Overengineered

*by Sean O'Rourke, ...*

Welcome to Overengineered's Developer Guide! This text assumes you have an understanding of 
programming and programming concepts.

A good portion of the tech stack is in Rust. Though this text does not require you to have a
strong Rust background, you should be familiar with the 
[Rust Book](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/title-page.html). If you haven't read it, don't fret,
everything's shiny. If you have experience with Python or JavaScript and React, it's well written 
and not difficult to get through.

In this text we'll learn a little bit about the platforms and services we support and use, then 
take a journey through concepts of Web 3.0 and how we are approaching this effort. Finally we'll
take a deep dive into the features and tools we've built and curated to accelerate development in
this new environment.
